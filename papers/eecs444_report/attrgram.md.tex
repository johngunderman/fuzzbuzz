\section{Annotating Context Free Grammars with Attributes}

Context free grammars can be annotated with synthesized attributes using a
straight forward process if the types of attributes are reasonably restricted.
For this paper we allow three types of attributes: 1) production choice, eg.
which production for the non-terminal was chosen, 2) scalar attributes, eg. the
value of a token or the name of a token, 3) set attributes, eg. collections of
scalar attributes. 

why the restrictions are reasonable 

exact bound on what can be expressed

\subsection{Algorithm Sketch}

All possible attributes are synthesized

Conditions are proposed based, and tested against operational inputs. Only those
conditions which pass all operational inputs are kept.

Attributes un-used by final conditions are pruned.
