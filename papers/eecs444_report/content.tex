\begin{abstract}
Blackbox Fuzzing, a type automated dynamic test generation, has been heavily
used to find security vulnerabilities and faults in software. We propose a new
form of Blackbox Fuzzing: Inferred Attribute Grammar Fuzzing. Attribute grammars
have a long distinguished history in specifying context sensitive restrictions to
context free languages. We use them here to assist with generating correct
randomized inputs for programs with structured input languages.  Attribute
Grammars are time consuming to write by hand, and a grammar for the input
language of the program under test may not be available. Therefore, we
present a multi-step approach to constructing inferred Attribute Grammars useful
for Fuzz Testing. Our approach assumes the existence of a large set of
operational inputs.
